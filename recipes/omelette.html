        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When I've rolled out of bed in the morning and can't bear to face the day,
             I tend to find some fatty food is a good first step to chase the morning grog away.
             I try to avoid carbohydrates when possible, so the omelette has become indispensible 
             in my culinary reportoire.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack two eggs into a bowl, stir to mix</li>
            <li>Add a little bit of butter to a pan and place over heat until the butter has melted
                and is bubbling
            </li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture over the butter</li>
            <li>Once the bottom of the egg mixture had cooked and is solid, use a spatula
                to lift one end of the omelette over the other, keeping the uncooked egg mixture 
                inside like an envelope
            </li>
            <li>Immediately flip the omelette over and cook until the outside is sealed (I prefer 
                not to cook the inside of the omelette too much!)
            </li>
            <li>You may want to brush some butter off the omelette with a paper towel</li>
            <li>Add a little salt, and a lot of pepper</li>
        </ol>
