# odin-recipes
For the Odin Recipes Project
A practice website containing recipes made as part of The Odin Project's course on web development.
The website will contain an index page with links to various recipes.
This project is intended to demonstrate HTML knowledge, and will be updated in the future with CSS stylings. It will also be an independent project made with a git-based workflow.
